# Synthetic Token Factory

This project involves creating a Synthetic Token Factory on the blockchain. The factory includes a suite of smart contracts, APIs, and front-end interfaces. The framework is modular and scalable, and it includes a robust governance and compliance module. The project is developed using a specific tech stack, and it is hosted on a Git repository. The project also involves setting up a testing framework and a CI/CD pipeline. The project is developed in iterations, with each iteration involving the development of a specific feature or set of features. The project also involves conducting code reviews and documenting the code and system architecture.
